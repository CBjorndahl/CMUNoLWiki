In terms of language and culture, I have shifted much more towards descriptivism, and see the value in documenting the language people use instead of trying to change what they say.  I do, however, think that there isn't anything inherently wrong with correcting grammar or pronunciation. Within a dialect there are rules that determine what is well-formed and how words are pronounced. I do know the distinction between making a mistake and using something that I personally perceive as not well-formed. If I believe that if somebody is making a mistake, there isn't any harm in trying to rectify that. There have been numerous times when I have made pronunciation mistakes because I only learned a word from reading and had never heard it pronounced. I am grateful that my pronunciation was corrected.  On the other hand, there are some things that sound wrong to me, but are well-formed in the speaker's dialect. In that case, I would hopefully recognize it as a valid construct in the dialect of the speaker, and I wouldn't correct them for that. As a child, I had a fairly strong British accent, and I remember my pronunciation of ""been"" being corrected. I used [bin] when I was expected to use [bɪn].
